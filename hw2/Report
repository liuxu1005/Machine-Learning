Experiment 1,  train on different size for smooth = 0/1

for both ibmmac data and sport data:
1)Accuracy for smooth = 0 is much worse than for smooth = 1;

2)Accuracy for botho smooth = 0 and smooth = 1 are increasing as train set size grows;

I think that's because larger train set provide more information for classifying; and
smoothing avoid we make decision only according to 1 features.

3)Stand deviation for smooth = 1  is decreasing as train set size grows;
  the trend for smooth = 0 is increasing as train set size grows although not obvious;
Probably it because without smoothing, one odd feature would lead us to wrong direction.



Experiment 2,  train on changing smooth:

for both ibmmac data and sport data:

1)when smooth is larger than 1, the accuracy is decreasing as smooth grows;
 the stand deviation is increasing as smooth grows;
Probably because over-smoothing will magnify the effects of low frequency features too much.

2)when smooth is between 0 and 1, there is no obvious trend although it increases accuracy
 by avoiding decision from only one odd feature.  The effects of smooth between 0 and 1 
 don't distinguish from each other much.
