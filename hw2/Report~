Experiment 1,  train on different size for smooth = 0/1

for both ibmmac data and sport data:
1)Accuracy for smooth = 0 is much worse than for smooth = 1;

2)Accuracy for botho smooth = 0 and smooth = 1 are increasing as train set size grows;

3)Stand deviation for smooth = 1  is decreasing as train set size grows;
  the trend for smooth = 0 is increasing as train set size grows although not obvious;
