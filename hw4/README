Readme for hw 4 comp 135 Xu Liu

This submit includes  
        perceptron.py which is a python program
        test which is script
        README
        Report
        
1. test
script for test additional files
test lines for homework data files is commented

to run :  just type ./test

has been changed mod to executable file by chmod +x ./test
if not runnable please do chmod again.

2. perceptron.py

It needs two arguments: -t for test data file
                       -T for train data file
It print out accuracy of knn and perceptron to stand out.

When  run,  it  output  two  lines,  each with 9 numbers 
giving the accuracies for k-NN (firrst line) and perceptron (second line) 
in the order:  primal, polynomial kernel (d = 1,2,3,4,5), RBF kernel with
(s = 0.1,0.5,1)
                       
for example,  
        python perceptron.py -T ./ATrain.arff -t ./ATest.arff 
        
 will calculate ATrain.arff and ATest.arff in current folder.  

3. Report   
   Result and observation.
