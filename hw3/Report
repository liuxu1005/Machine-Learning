3.2 Sensitivity to initialization

From observation on graphs of CS and NMI over initialization,
1) CS and NMI are stable across multiple initializations,
   they are not sensitive to whatever initializations;
2) Basically, The data set with good CS will also get good NMI;
   however, which extent the agreement can achieve depends on data set.
   The agreement extents may vary over different data set.

3.3 Selecting k

From observation on graphs of CS over different k,
we can see as k grows from 1, the CS decrease quickly first until
it reaches certain point, and then will decrease slow.
Although the trend is not necessarily very obvious for each data set
, it is still there. We can use CS as a reference for choosing k.
